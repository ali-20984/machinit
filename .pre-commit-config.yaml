# Note: This configuration uses the system-installed `shfmt` and `shellcheck` binaries
# (language: system) so developers can manage versions via their package manager.
# To install pre-commit and enable hooks:
#   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pre-commit
#   pre-commit install
# Or run the helper script: `dev_scripts/install-precommit.sh`
