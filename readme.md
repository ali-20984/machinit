# machinit — macOS bootstrap & dotfiles installer

> A curated macOS bootstrap and dotfiles installer designed for reproducible, opinionated developer setups. Includes a safe installer flow, shell aliases & functions, zsh completions, and a test harness to validate changes.

Key goals:
- reproducible machine setup for dev environments
- safe, audit-friendly defaults with a DRY_RUN (dry-run) mode
- curated CLI completions, aliases, and helper scripts for productivity

---

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supermarsx/machinit.git
cd machinit
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

2. See what would change without applying anything:

```bash
./install.sh --dry-run
```

3. Customize `config.toml` before running for any machine-specific settings.


## What this repo contains (short)

- `install.sh` — top-level orchestrator (supports flags like `--dry-run`, `--resume-failure`, `--clear-logs`).
- `scripts/` — many ordered scripts to install packages, configure system settings, and apply UI customizations.
- `assets/` — dotfiles, zsh completion files, themes, and templates.
- `dev_scripts/` — test, fetcher, and maintenance helpers (fetch completions, run the test harness, linting helpers).
- `dev_scripts/generate_inventory.py` — generates a current list of aliases, functions, completions, install targets and defaults into `docs/inventory.md` (run locally to refresh).
- `tests/` — local test harness that validates non-destructive behavior (safely using DRY_RUN).

---

## Global gitignore

This repository provides a recommended global gitignore at `assets/.gitignore_global`. It is intended as a sensible default for macOS developer machines and includes common ignores for:

- OS files and caches (macOS)
- Editors / IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains/IntelliJ/Android Studio)
- Language/tool build artifacts (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java/Gradle, Ruby/Rails, PHP/Composer)
- Mobile/tooling (Android/Kotlin, Xcode/iOS)
- Containers / infra (Docker, Terraform)
- Environment and secret files (e.g. `.env`, private keys)

How to use it locally as your global excludes file:

```bash
cp assets/.gitignore_global ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Notes:
- The file is meant to be a convenient starting point — review and customize it for your workflow before applying globally.
- It intentionally does not ignore dependency lockfiles (e.g. `package-lock.json`, `Gemfile.lock`, `Cargo.lock`) since those are commonly committed for reproducible builds.
- Contributions and additions are welcome; keep unrelated repo-specific ignores out of the global file.

## Functions

The following helper functions are provided in `assets/.functions`. Source that file into your shell (`source /path/to/machinit/assets/.functions`) to make these available in your interactive session.

- `mkd` — create a new directory (with parents) and immediately `cd` into it.
- `cdf` — change working directory to the top-most Finder window location (macOS Finder integration).
- `targz` — create a `.tar.gz` archive using `zopfli`, `pigz` or `gzip` (chooses best available compressor).
- `fs` — show size of a file or total size of a directory in a human-readable form (portable `du` wrapper).
- `diff` — use Git’s colored diff when available (`git diff --no-index --color-words`).
- `dataurl` — produce a data URL (base64) from a file; sets proper mime-type for text files.
- `server` — start a simple HTTP server (Python) from the current directory and open it in a browser; enables CORS.
- `gz` — compare original and gzipped file sizes and print ratio.
- `digga` — run `dig` with useful flags to show concise DNS answers.
- `getcertnames` — print the Common Name and Subject Alternative Names from an HTTPS certificate for a domain.
- `o` — `open` wrapper: `o` opens the current directory if called without args, otherwise opens its arguments.
- `tre` — enhanced `tree` alias: show hidden files, color, ignore `.git` and `node_modules`, view with `less`.
- `generate_git_key` — interactive helper to generate a new SSH key (ed25519), add it to the ssh-agent/keychain, and instruct how to add the public key to GitHub.
- `myaliases` — print a formatted table of aliases and functions (supports `--aliases`, `--functions`, `--all`).
- `findPid` — helper to find process IDs by process name/regex (uses `lsof -t -c`).
- `recent` — `cd` to the most recently modified project directory under `~/Projects` (supports indexing and name patterns).
- `ll` — robust `ls` wrapper that prefers GNU `ls`/`gls` but falls back safely for BSD systems.
- `myip` — robust public IP lookup with multiple service fallbacks and optional IPv6 support.


These functions are written to be safe for interactive shells (bash/zsh). If you rely on shell-specific features, consider sourcing the file from the appropriate rc file (e.g. `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`).

## Aliases

The following aliases are provided in `assets/.aliases` for quick command-line shortcuts.

Note: these aliases live in `assets/.aliases`. Source this file from your shell rc to enable them (for example, add `source /path/to/machinit/assets/.aliases` to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). The file is intended to be compatible with both bash and zsh; do not execute it directly because aliases defined in a subshell will not persist in your interactive shell.

## System tweaks & defaults (summary)

This installer applies a curated set of macOS preference tweaks and system settings across multiple scripts. Most changes are DRY_RUN-safe and are applied using `defaults write`, `pmset`, `nvram`, `dockutil`, or the helper `set_user_default` to target per-user domains. Changes that require elevated privileges write to `/Library/Preferences` or are run with `sudo`.

High-level categories of tweaks applied by the installer:

- **UI / Appearance:** enable Dark Mode, reduce transparency, disable many window animations, set system accent/highlight values, show battery percentage.
- **Dock & Mission Control:** adjust icon size, enable auto-hide with no delay/animation, minimize-to-application, hide recent apps, speed up Mission Control animations, pin curated apps and folder stacks (via `dockutil`).
- **Finder & Sidebar:** show all filename extensions, enable status/path bars, default to List view, prevent `.DS_Store` on network/USB volumes, configure sidebar items and default new-window location, unhide `~/Library` and `/Volumes`.
- **Safari:** privacy/security changes (disable search suggestions, show full URL, enable Develop menu, disable AutoFill, disable Java/plugins, block pop-ups), clear Favorites/History when requested, and postpone Safari recommendation notices.
- **Spotlight:** restrict indexing to Applications only and disable web/Siri suggestions and Spotlight query suggestions.
- **Power & Performance:** SSD-friendly settings (hibernatemode, remove sleepimage), enable HiDPI, pmset tweaks (lid wake, display sleep, low power mode), and disable some background agents where possible.
- **Input devices & keyboard:** disable swipe navigation, adjust keyboard illumination, map Fn to Emoji & Symbols, disable automatic capitalization/quotes/period substitution and auto-correct.
- **Security & Privacy:** disable crash reporting/auto-submit, enable Application Firewall + stealth/block-all, disable AirDrop/AirPlay Receiver, and disable quarantine prompts for Brew-installed apps where configured.
- **System apps & utilities:** prevent Photos auto-open on plug, Time Machine behavior tweaks, Activity Monitor showing all processes, TextEdit defaults (UTF-8), and App Store/Software Update preferences.
- **Terminal & iTerm2:** import themes, set Terminal encoding and secure keyboard entry, and inject a theme prompt block into `~/.zshrc`.

Notes:

- Many preference writes are best-effort and may be ignored by newer macOS versions, MDM profiles, or TCC restrictions. Where applicable, scripts check for Full Disk Access or use `execute_as_user` to write per-user preferences.
- Restarts of Finder/Dock/SystemUIServer are deferred to `scripts/999_restart_apps.sh` so changes are applied together at the end of a full run.

## Firefox extensions

The installer can configure Firefox via a `policies.json` file to auto-install curated extensions. The current curated list (written by `scripts/020_configure_firefox_policies.sh`) is:

- `uBlock Origin` — content blocker for ads and trackers.
- `Violentmonkey` — userscript manager for custom client-side scripts.
- `Stylus` — site-specific CSS manager for custom styling.
- `FoxyProxy Standard` — advanced proxy management helper.
- `Dark Reader` — per-site dark mode for websites.
- `ColorZilla` — eyedropper and color utilities for web design.
- `Bitwarden` — password manager and vault integration.
- `Clear Cache` — quick cache clearing helper for Firefox.

These are installed by `scripts/020_configure_firefox_policies.sh` into Firefox's `distribution/policies.json` (requires Full Disk Access to write into the app bundle path when run locally).

## Visual Studio Code extensions

The installer installs a small curated list of VS Code extensions (see `scripts/031_install_vscode_extensions.sh`). Current extensions include:

- `openai.chatgpt` — OpenAI / ChatGPT integration for editor assistance.
- `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` — ESLint integration for JavaScript/TypeScript linting.
- `github.vscode-github-actions` — GitHub Actions workflow tooling.
- `github.copilot-chat` — GitHub Copilot Chat extension.
- `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint` — Markdown linting rules and validation.
- `christian-kohler.npm-intellisense` — npm package auto-imports for JS/TS.
- `timonwong.shellcheck` — ShellCheck integration for shell script linting.
- `rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline` — curated tooling (installed when available).
- `chadbaileyvh.oled-pure-black---vscode` — dark OLED-friendly theme.
- `streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker` — spelling diagnostics for code and docs.

VS Code extensions are installed by `scripts/031_install_vscode_extensions.sh` using the `code` CLI when available; the script is DRY_RUN-aware and will skip installation in CI/dry-run modes.

## Test harness & CI

We validate changes using the test harness `dev_scripts/test.sh`. This script discovers tests under `tests/` and runs them in a safe manner.

Common commands:

```bash
# Run all tests (shell + python where applicable)
./dev_scripts/test.sh

# Run only completion-related tests and print output
./dev_scripts/test.sh --pattern completions --verbose

# Use the pytest mode for python tests when helpful
./dev_scripts/test.sh --pytest
```

Local development checklist:

1. Make edits to completions, scripts, dotfiles
2. Run linting: `./dev_scripts/lint.sh`
3. Run focused tests: `./dev_scripts/test.sh --pattern completions --verbose`
4. If everything passes, commit and open a PR

CI note: the repository has a GitHub Actions pipeline that runs these tests for PRs and pushes — keep changes test-friendly and DRY_RUN-safe.

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions — typical flows:

1. Fork and create topic branch.
2. Make small, well-scoped changes (completions, scripts, docs, tests).
3. Add/adjust tests in `tests/` to exercise changes, prefer DRY_RUN-friendly assertions.
4. Run the test harness locally and ensure green CI.

Developer tips:

- Keep completions conservative and offline-friendly (avoid network calls during shell completion evaluation).
- Use `dev_scripts/fetch_completions.py` to fetch or regenerate helpful completions.
- If replacing an existing completion file, keep a backup copy or prefer `.generated` suffix until changes are validated.

---

## Security & Notes

This installer makes system-level changes and should be audited carefully before running. Use `--dry-run` and test on disposable machines or VMs if in doubt.

---

## License

MIT — see `license.md`.

---

If you'd like, I can also generate:
- a single cheat-sheet markdown (commands + flags) for tools we polished (e.g., Copilot, Codex, OpenCode), or
- machine-readable JSON/YAML specifications for completions (useful for generating richer completions).
